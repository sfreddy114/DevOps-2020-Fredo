## Create a file

Next, youâ€™ll add***a new file to this repository.

* Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
* Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
* Enter your name in the empty file space.
* Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
* Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
